**DEPRECATED** I no longer use this; rather, I use [IRCCloud](https://irccloud.com/) to maintain my IRC presence.

# znc-config
The config for my ZNC-based IRC bouncer

## Usage

Clone this repo, and run `make`. That should do everything save setting
up passwords and certs, and installing it as a system service. Not sure
about that yet.
